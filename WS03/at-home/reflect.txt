1. Well as far as i understood, we have only one element in the family and have given name for that account.We are told to store one element in each member.

2.That feature is called overlaoding and it allows us to have 2 functions in the same scope with same name, although we can have differernt definitions for them.

3.We have learned to have a class with private and public data members and how to access the private data members with the data functions and we have learned about overloading.
